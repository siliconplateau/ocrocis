Ocrocis
===============================================================================

A project manager interface for Thomas Breuel's *Ocropy*, a toolkit for training optical character recognition (OCR) models with long short term memory networks (<https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy>).

*Ocrocis* guides the user in training high-quality OCR models from raw PDFs or images. It features automatic project management with a minimalistic philosophy:

- Smart parameter inference, few required arguments
- Non-redundant disk usage via hardlinks (only Linux)
- Only core-Perl dependencies (aside *Ocropy*'s native dependencies')

Developed for Linux and Mac OS X.

Please refer to the documentation at *Cistern*, the offical repository for all software developed at the **Center for Information and Language Processing, University of Munich**:
